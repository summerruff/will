              I love this picture of us, it's one of my favorites:) This was one

              This picture is from when we celebrated our first Valentine's
              together! You cooked me dinner (like the amazingly perfect and
              caring boyfriend you are)
              and it was probably the best thing I've ever eaten!! Maybe because
              it was made with love:)

              I love waking up next to you baby, almost as much as I love
              falling asleep wrapped up in your arms. I can't believe that we
              really
              get to start waking up every morning with each other in just a
              couple days!

              I took this picture because we both had on flannel pajama pants

              Showering with you is one of my favorite parts of the day:) I love
              getting to share a space with you in any environment, I just love
              being close
              to you! I don't think I'll ever want to go back to showering alone
