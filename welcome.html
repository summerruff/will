                Being with you is the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I'm so excited to spend life with you. I can't wait to see where our future takes us, 
                and I know wherever we go I'll be happy because I have you. How could I ever want more when I already have my whole world by my side. You are genuinely 
                my everything, which I know I say a lot. But you are. You're my life, my love, my future, my hope.
            </p>

                Loving you is going to be the adventure of a lifetime my love. I couldn't imagine life any other way. I know that when our souls were created, ours were 
                destined to be together. You are without a shadow of a doubt my soulmate in every way possible. My other half. My person. It never ceases to amaze me how 
                perfectly we go together. I've never had such a strong connection so instantly with anyone the way that we did, but I knew it was a sign that you were the one.

                I love you Will. With every breath I take, every fiber of my being, I love you. You're truly amazing and I'm so lucky to call you mine. The light and love of my life.
